# Legacy
This is the first version of the theme for [r/TheDragonPrince](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheDragonPrince) and is no longer being maintained as it is very close to Reddit's CSS limit of 100Kb, is buggy because of the way stuff is being moved around, and is just messy.

If you still want to set it up, you can follow the instructions [over here](https://github.com/ncla/musereddit#development-setup), as this was based on that project.
